This project implements and evaluates a banditâ€“based active learning framework, inspired by the paper Ensemble Active Learning by Contextual Bandits for AI Incubation in Manufacturing. The framework incorporates exploration- and exploitation-oriented agents and applies the Exp4.P core function to combine their decisions for sample acquisition.
